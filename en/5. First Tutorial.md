The ideia of this bot is recognize positive and negative answers, so first we can write a sentence and related it with an intent, in this case the sentence is yes and the intent is positive.

You need at least two sentences for each intent to start the training.

We added two intents positive and negative with two sentences each one, when you finished to build the data you can train your bot clicking on Training.
